# Google Classroom Replica using .Net - Leveraging Design Pattern Concepts

This project is a Google Classroom Replica developed using .Net, designed to demonstrate the effective use of software design patterns and clean architectural principles. It replicates the essential functionalities of Google Classroom—such as classroom creation, user roles, assignment management, submissions, and announcements—while maintaining a modular, scalable, and maintainable code structure.

The system leverages key design patterns (including Factory, Observer, Strategy, and Repository) to ensure clear separation of concerns, reusability of components, and flexibility for future enhancements. It also follows strong object-oriented programming (OOP) practices, emphasizing abstraction, encapsulation, and interface-driven development.

Additionally, the project includes an interactive UI/UX prototype created using Proto.io, providing a visual blueprint of the application’s layout, user flow, and overall design approach. This prototype complements the development work and highlights the planned user experience.

Overall, this project serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of how real-world systems can be engineered using modern design concepts in C#, making it ideal for learning, portfolios, and architectural exploration.
